# 🚀 Cybersecurity Salary Analysis

This repository contains my **AI Lab Project**, where I analyze a real-world dataset related to **cybersecurity job salaries** using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Google Colab**.  
The purpose of this project is to understand salary trends based on job roles, experience levels, and remote work ratios in the cybersecurity field.
